# Neural_Supreme_Court_Prediction
Bare Bones Source code for Neural Supreme Court Prediction. This is the basic and initial code for the project. The paper 'Using Modern Neural Networks to Predict the Decisions of Supreme Court of the United States with State-of-the-Art Accuracy' uses a more advanced model, which unfortunately cannot be released.
